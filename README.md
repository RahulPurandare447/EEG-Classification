# EEG-Classification
Several GitHub repositories offer valuable resources for EEG signal classification using various neural network architectures, including CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, and autoencoder-based FCNN. For instance, the repository BigProject explores EEG data classification by implementing CNN, LSTM/GRU, and hybrid models. Another repository, CNN-EEG, focuses on applying convolutional neural networks to multi-electrode EEG signals for classification. The EEG-DL library is a TensorFlow-based deep learning framework that provides implementations of CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, and autoencoder-based FCNN models, specifically tailored for EEG tasks. Additionally, the repository EEG-Classification-Neural-Networks compares the effectiveness of CNN, LSTM, and GRU models in classifying EEG signals, while the eeg-classification-model demonstrates a hybrid CNN/RNN approach for extracting both spatial and temporal features from EEG data. These repositories offer comprehensive codebases and documentation, making them valuable for researchers and practitioners working on EEG signal analysis and classification.
